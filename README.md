🚀 Project Steps
1. Data Loading (Python)

Imported dataset using Pandas

Inspected structure, columns, data types

Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Data distributions

Correlation analysis

Trend and category analysis

Visualizations to understand patterns


3. Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates

Treated missing values

Fixed inconsistent formats

Converted data types

Exported cleaned dataset for SQL & Power BI


4. SQL Analysis

Executed queries on PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server to:

Filter and sort data

Perform aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Use joins for combining tables

Run window functions for advanced analytics

Generate insights to support decision-making


5. Power BI Dashboard

Built an interactive dashboard containing:

KPIs and summary metrics

Trend analysis

Category-wise breakdowns

Filters/slicers for exploration

Visuals that support insights from Python and SQL

Dashboard File: dashboard.pbix


6. Final Report

Summarized insights from Python, SQL, and Power BI

Covered findings, patterns, and recommendations

Designed as a clean, easy-to-read document for stakeholders
